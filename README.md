# attackdefendCNN 

This is a clone of the project "AttackDefendCNN", a group project for the course "Deep Learning - From Theory to Practice" at the University of Twente. The project is done by four students: Hung Nguyen (owner of this github account), Franka van Jaarsveld (f.vanjaarsveld@student.utwente.nl), Agata Sowa (a.m.sowa@student.utwente.nl), and Jakub Nail (j.f.nail@student.utwente.nl). 

The report paper can be found [here](https://github.com/ngqhung0912/attackdefendCNN/blob/main/2022_1B_Deep_Learning_Project_Group24.pdf). In this paper, we discuss different methods of attack (Fast Gradient Sign Method - FSGM, and Iterative-FSGM), and different methods of defending a CNN model, including data augmentation, student-teacher model, and neural adversarial training. The original CNN model's architecture is found on the paper, and the model is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
